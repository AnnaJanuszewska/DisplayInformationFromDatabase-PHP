# DisplayInformationFromDatabase-PHP

## Overview
This is 5th assignment for PHP & mySQL Classes in Baruch College.

## Details
Create an About Us page for a dummy company. On this page, display the list of departments that exist in the departments table. At minimum, you should submit two files: one file to connect to the database, and another that displays the page with the list of departments included. Get as creative as you like; a bare page with a list is not acceptable.
